,English,Scores in AMCAT English section,"AMCAT or Aspiring Minds Computer Adaptive Test is an employability assessment test to assess the aptitude, reasoning and technical skills of students and new graduates. It is a statistical assessment platform to provide the skill measurements for each student who takes up the test. The assessments focus on three primary skills â€“ cognitive (which include tests like English ability, Logical ability, Quantitative ability, Attention to detail), domain (which includes a test on the specific branch of studies taken up by the student) and personality (based on the big-5 personality traits).
The scores are measured and reported on a scale of 100-900 (barring the personality assessments).

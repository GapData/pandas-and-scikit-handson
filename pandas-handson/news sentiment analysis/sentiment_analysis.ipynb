    "i. Training and Testing\n",

    "In the diagram above, the linear model is underfit\n",

    " - If you provide new data to this model, it will not change it's behavior(shape) (low variance)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the model with high degree polynomial at the right is overfit\n",
    " - The model will take into account all the data points (low bias)\n",
    " - The curve will try to change it's shape in order to capture new data points, loosing the generality of the model (high variance)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Cross Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time, when we are developing ML model we simply split the data randomly into train and test set and feed into our model. While doing so, we may have a high accuracy on that particular chunk of training data set. What if your model perform differently and give lower accuracy while feeding different chuncks of from the sama data points? So, in cross-validation, we will be creating number of train/test splits and measure the accuracy by calculating average on each of the spits.\n",

    "of the word present in your document (one word represents one column in DataFrame). And,\n",
    "when you have new document, it simply maps 1 if the word is present in that document\n",
    "otherwise map to 0.\n",

    " So, we need to find a way to reduce the weightage of word `is`. One of the method is calculating reciprocal of the count value, which minimizes the significant of word `is` in the document. But, you might face another problem here. Suppose, you encounter a word in your document (let's say `stratovolcano` having rare occurence in your document). If you take reciprocal of this occurence, you will get 1 (or close to 1 - hightest weightage). But, this word does not give much sense about `Montains`.\n",
